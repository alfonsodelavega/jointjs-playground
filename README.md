# jointjs-playground

Testing the usage of the [jointjs](https://www.jointjs.com/) diagramming library.

## Instructions

You need npm to download the project dependencies.

Just a simple `npm install` in the project folder is required, and then the `index.html` file should show a basic class diagram that I use for tests.

## Relevant files

- `src/classDiagram.js`: defines the elements of the diagram.
- `src/ecore.js`: set of shapes used in the diagram (work in progress).

## Visual Studio Code Intellisense

The `jsconfig.json` file provides autocompletion and Typescript-based documentation for the library (very useful for trying things around).
